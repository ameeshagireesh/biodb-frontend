# Database on Non-Coding RNAs In Breast Cancer

## Overview of Methodology:
- At present, there exists no unique noncoding RNA databases on breast cancer, all the information that we get regarding them are from public biomedical databases such as NCBI.

- Call  API from a server code, and let the server code parse the response.

- Decipher the response to create our own table that will be displayed on webpage. 

- Information will be placed in our database, which will be updated regularly, because API will be called on a regular basis (such as every hour, every day, etc.) to see if there are any changes. <br>

- Tech stack - <br> 
    - Frontend - React.js
    - Backend - Node.js with GraphQL (for queries) and MongoDB (for DB).

- A review article based on specific noncoding RNAs in Breast Cancer will be written.
